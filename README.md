# pkmn-tcg-website

This is a work in progress website that allows the user to search for a Pokemon card thanks to the PokemonTCG API. It was built in React and is a fully functioning single-page application.

The main reason I made this website was to get better at using APIs and to improve upon my React skills. Most Pokemon TCG card search websites aren't built in React, so I thought it would be interesting to try it out.
